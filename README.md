# CocktailRecommendation
Based on given preferences, a cocktail recommendation will come.

This program will take in a string of flavor profiles from the user that they might enjoy in a cocktail, then recommends a cocktail off of said flavor profile.
It is done using a stop list and a bit of concatenation of the flavor profile which is then used to tailor a ranking system for the cocktail choice.
A highest ranked cocktail based on user given flavor profile is then returned.
